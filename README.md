# riot-points-codes-generator
# Hey, this is my first project so i thought that there couldn't be some secret to how Riot picks out their codes, it would be most likely a random string of letters and numbers, if anyone could improve on this base it would be gladly appreciated, and yes you could test them as well if there was any way to.
# And any support is appreciated! i'm gonna be graduating high school next year and i'm trying to learn programming to gather some funds to pay for my tuition
coded in c++
